# Age and Gender Prediction Model

## Overview
This project is an **OpenCV-based application** that uses a laptop's camera to **live-detect** age and gender. Using **OpenCV** for image processing and **TensorFlow/Keras** for model training, it achieves **81%+ accuracy** in gender classification and an **MAE of 8** in age estimation. The application draws a **rectangle** around detected faces and displays the predictions in real time.

## Features
- **Live Age and Gender Detection** using a laptop camera.
- **Gender Prediction**: Achieves over **81% accuracy**.
- **Age Estimation**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of **8 years**.
- **Real-time Processing**: Optimized for quick inference.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Built using **CNN architectures**.
- **Preprocessing with OpenCV**: Efficient facial detection and enhancement.

## Technologies Used
- **OpenCV** (for image processing and real-time detection)
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (for deep learning)
- **Python** (for scripting and development)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mohitkumhar/age-gender-prediction.git
   cd age-gender-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python live_detect.py
   ```

## Usage
- The application **opens the laptop camera** and detects faces in real time.
- It draws a **rectangle around detected faces** and displays the **predicted age and gender**.
- Can be used for **surveillance, demographic analysis, and user profiling**.
